		<p>Thank you for veiwing my web page about one of the many things I love and enjoy talking about in this world.<br> These aircraft are actual real world vehicles and are actually used by various countries around the world, in war air superiority plays an important role in the outcome of a battle and can effect the tide of battle the first aircraft used in war was just for reconnaissance in WWI. but as the war went on planes became weaponised and played crucial roles in the outcome of a war.<br> Even in peace times the "military" aviation industry never stopped developing faster and better aircraft.</p>
